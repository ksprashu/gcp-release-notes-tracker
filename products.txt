Product launch stages

   (BUTTON) Expand all

Preview

   At Preview, products or features are ready for testing by customers.
   Preview offerings are often publicly announced, but are not necessarily
   feature-complete, and no SLAs or technical support commitments are
   provided for these. Unless stated otherwise by Google, Preview
   offerings are intended for use in test environments only. The average
   Preview stage lasts about six months.

General Availability

   General Availability products and features are open to all customers,
   ready for production use, and covered by a [41]Google Cloud SLA, where
   applicable. Google typically supports General Availability products and
   features through APIs, CLIs, and the Google Cloud Console, except in
   unusual circumstances where providing one or more of the foregoing
   capabilities is unreasonable in the context of the particular product
   or feature.

Deprecated

   Deprecated features are scheduled to be shut down and removed. For more
   information, see the "Discontinuation of Services" section of the
   Google Cloud Platform [42]Terms of Service.

[Legacy] Early access, alpha, beta

   Early access: Early access features are limited to a closed group of
   testers for a limited subset of launches. Participation is by
   invitation only and may require signing a pre-general-availability
   agreement, including confidentiality provisions. These features may be
   unstable, change in backward-incompatible ways, and are not guaranteed
   to be released. There are no SLAs provided and no technical support
   obligations. Early access releases are rare and focus on validating
   product prototypes.

   Alpha: Alpha is a limited-availability test before releases are cleared
   for more widespread use. Our focus with alpha testing is to verify
   functionality and gather feedback from a limited set of customers.
   Typically, alpha participation is by invitation and subject to
   pre-general-availability terms. Alpha releases don't have to be feature
   complete, no SLAs are provided, and there are no technical support
   obligations. However, alphas are generally suitable for use in test
   environments. The alpha phase usually lasts six months.

   Beta: At beta, products or features are ready for broader customer
   testing and use. Betas are often publicly announced. There are no SLAs
   or technical support obligations in a beta release unless otherwise
   specified in product terms or the terms of a particular beta program.
   The average beta phase lasts about six months.
